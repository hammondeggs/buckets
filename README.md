### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue xd / prologue sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER MODULATION EFFECTS tab on the librarian, and press Receive ALL to upload your existing user oscillators. Now, drag and drop the requisite file to an available slot in the librarian :
 - for minilogue xd users, please use buckets.mnlgxdunit
 - for prologue users, please use buckets.prlgunit for now, please note this has NOT been tested on a prologue yet.
 

You should now see buckets V1.01-1 listed in your user modulation effects. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer.

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

### usage

The effect comprises of 3 delays, with 3x 2 LFOs 120 degrees apart from each other modulating their respective delays.

- 3x Slow "Chorus/Ensemble" LFOs
- 3x Fast "Vibrato" LFOs

For each delay, the two LFOs are mixed together to form a unique waveform to adjust the delay time by.

The delayed results are mixed full wet (no source signal is present) with the first delay mixed to centre, the second mixed to left, and the third mixed to the right.

By default the effect should start with a fairly close approximation of a typical 'string machine'. You have two LFOs you can adjust the depth of, and this is done with the Time and Depth knobs.

- Adjust "Time(Speed on prologue)" to set the depth of the slow "Chorus/Ensemble" LFO
- Adjust "Depth" to set the depth of the fast "Vibrato" LFO.

It is when you combine these, you can get the "string machine" sound.

(Or, just use the ensemble or vibrato chorus alone if you like!)




#### Play around with the settings and have fun!

### brigade

Brigade, is a fixed value version of the effect, that cannot have its values adjusted. Preferable when you just want that triple chorus sound without any tweaking.
