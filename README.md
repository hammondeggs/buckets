# buckets!

A triple bucket brigade style MOD effect for your KORG Minilogue XD synthesizer!

# As always, especially with the KORG user oscillators, these are to be used at your own risk!

### A quick word...
I've been having a ton of fun creating these plugins, and it's thirsty work. If you like stuff like this and my other work, by all means feel free to contribute whatever you can to the fund to help fund the beer supply!

## Note! Currently only a minilogue xd version is available (until testing has been performed on a prologue)!


### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue xd sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER MODULATION EFFECTS tab on the librarian, and press Receive ALL to upload your existing user oscillators. Now, drag and drop the requisite file to an available slot in the librarian :
 - for Minilogue xd users, please use buckets.mnlgxdunit
 
 *Note, at this point a prologue version has not been created as it has not been tested on a prologue unit yet.*

You should now see buckets V1.00-1 listed in your user modulation effects. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer.

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

### usage

The effect comprises of 3 delays, with 3x 2 LFOs 120 degrees apart from each other modulating their respective delays.

- 3x Slow "Chorus/Ensemble" LFOs
- 3x Fast "Vibrato" LFOs

For each delay, the two LFOs are mixed together to form a unique waveform to adjust the delay time by.

The delayed results are mixed full wet (no source signal is present) with the first delay mixed to centre, the second mixed to left, and the third mixed to the right.

By default the effect should start with a fairly close approximation of a typical 'string machine'. You have two LFOs you can adjust the depth of, and this is done with the Time and Depth knobs.

- Adjust "Time" to set the depth of the slow "Chorus/Ensemble" LFO
- Adjust "Depth" to set the depth of the fast "Vibrato" LFO.

It is when you combine these, you can get the "string machine" sound.

(Or, just use the ensemble or vibrato chorus alone if you like!)




#### Play around with the settings,it becomes pretty clear fairly quickly.
